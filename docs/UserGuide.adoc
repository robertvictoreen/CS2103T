== Introduction

EazyTutors is an application for tutors or teachers who prefer a virtual way to manage a class of students. It allows
users to mark students' attendance, as well as checking on students' individual progress. This helps users customise
their teaching to students with different capabilities. It boasts extra features such as calculating the class
statistics and assignment statistics. EazyTutors is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). You won't need to bring around attendance
sheets anymore with EazyTutors! Interested? Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order if all the parameters have prefixes e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
