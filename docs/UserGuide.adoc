== Introduction

EazyTutors is an application for tutors or teachers who prefer a virtual way to record students’ attendance. It
also boasts extra features to check on students’ progress and helps users customise their teaching to students
with different capabilities. EazyTutors is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). You won't need to bring around attendance
sheets anymore with EazyTutors! Interested? Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order if all the parameters have prefixes e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
