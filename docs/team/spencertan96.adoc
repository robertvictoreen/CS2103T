== PROJECT: EazyTutors

---

== Overview

=== Purpose
* This project portfolio was written to document my role and contributions to the **EazyTutors** project. I was
responsible for creating the `Note` feature and the Details Panel that shows a selected student's progress.

=== The Team
* My team comprises of students from the National University of Singapore and we decided on creating this application
after observing the hassle tutors have to deal with when marking attendance.

=== The Application
* EazyTutors is a desktop statistics recording application used for managing classes of students. It was created with
NUS tutors in mind, but can be extended to tutors or teachers from other organizations as well. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

=== Features
* Mark students' attendance
* Record students' assignment scores
* Calculate assignment statistics
* Calculate class performance
* Add students' photos
* Record notes about students

== Summary of contributions

=== Preface
This section serves to inform you of the improvements I made to the project, including code, documentation and
administrative tasks.

=== Enhancements

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add/delete/edit a student's note*
** What it does: allows the user to add, delete or edit notes specific to each student.
** Justification: This feature will help tutors remember their students better and customise their teaching towards each
student to be more effective. This would be especially helpful for tutors with large classes where it is very hard to
remember each and every student and their respective personalities.
** Highlights: Added notes are auto-punctuated. Each note added will have a full stop appended to its end if it does not
already end with either `!`,`?` or `.`. When more text is added to the note, the current text's full stop will be
changed to a `,` before the new text is added.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a panel in the GUI for displaying a student's details such as their assignment grades and
respective note.

* *Minor enhancement*: added some tests for enhanced `AddCommand`.
