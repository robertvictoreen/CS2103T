== PROJECT: EazyTutors

---

== Overview

=== Purpose
* This project portfolio was written to document my role and contributions to the **EazyTutors** project. I was
responsible for creating the `Attendance` related features and the display of students' attendance.

=== The Team
* My team comprises of students from the National University of Singapore and we decided on creating this application
after observing the hassle tutors have to deal with when marking attendance.

=== The Application
* EazyTutors is a desktop statistics recording application used for managing classes of students. It was created with
NUS tutors in mind, but can be extended to tutors or teachers from other organizations as well. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

=== Features
* Mark students' attendance
* Record students' assignment scores
* Calculate assignment statistics
* Calculate class performance
* Add students' photos
* Record notes about students

== Summary of contributions

=== Preface
This section serves to inform you of the improvements I made to the project, including code, documentation and
administrative tasks.

=== Enhancements

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add/delete/edit a class session*
** What it does: allows the user to add, delete or edit session information, and mark the attendance of a specific
student.
** Justification: This feature will allow tutors to mark and track the attendance of each student, so that marks could
be given for participation and tutors can direct their attention towards students who have missed their lessons,
to provide make-up lessons and help if necessary
** Highlights:

* *Minor enhancement*: added a panel in the GUI for displaying a student's attendance in lessons of a specific module.

* *Minor enhancement*: added some tests for enhanced `AddCommand`.
