== PROJECT: EazyTutors

---

== Overview

=== Purpose
* This project portfolio documents my role and contributions to the **EazyTutors** project. I was responsible for the grade statistics features and display of grades.

=== The Team
* My team comprises of students from the National University of Singapore and we decided on creating this application after observing the hassle tutors have to deal with when marking attendance.

=== The Application
* EazyTutors is a desktop statistics recording application used for managing classes of students. It was created with NUS tutors in mind, but can be extended to tutors or teachers from other organizations as well. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

=== Features
* Mark students' attendance
* Record students' assignment scores
* Calculate assignment statistics
* Calculate class performance
* Add students' photos
* Record notes about students

== Summary of contributions

=== Preface
This section describes my contribution to the project, including code, documentation and administrative tasks.

* *Major enhancement*: Grade Statistics
** What it does: Calculates the statistics for the grades of an individual assignment or the overall class.
** Justification: This feature enables tutors to analyse the grades of students to provide relative feedback based on the performance of the class.
** Highlights: Provides maximum, highest, lowest, 25th/75th percentiles, average, and median grade.

* *Minor enhancement*: Grade Display
** What it does: Displays the assignment grades and overall grade for each student.
** Justification: This enhancement enables tutors to view the performance of each student.
** Highlights: Calculates the total grade on demand using the specifications of the assignment model.

* *Minor enhancement*: Attendance Model
** What it does: Represents an attendance session for a particular date.
** Justification: This enhancement provides the model for the attendance feature.
** Highlights: Provides a mapping between each student and multiple attendance sessions with a record of attendance/absence for that session.

* *Minor enhancement*: Create new person from EditPersonDescriptor
** What it does: Parses command arguments to create the skeleton for a person with optional fields.
** Justification: Since creating a new Person requires non-null attributes,
this allows the creation of a new Person with the optional fields of EditPersonDescriptor.
** Highlights: This improves the cohesion because the attributes of the EditPersonDescriptor are populated within the class itself instead of set by another class.
The missing attributes are replaced with default values to create a valid new Person.
