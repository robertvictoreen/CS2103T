== PROJECT: EazyTutors

---

== Overview

=== Purpose
* This project portfolio was written to document my role and contribution to the **EazyTutors** project. I was responsible for doing the `Add Profile Photo` and `Sort` feature.

=== Team
* The team comprises of students from the National University of Singapore and we created this application because we realized that plenty of tutors find it difficult to manage their student's data such as attendance, marks, and grades.

=== Value Proposition of App
* To have a All-In-One student management tool for teachers or tutors since research data showed that tutors have difficulty with tracking attendance, marks and grades.

=== Features
* Records student's attendance
* Records student's assignment scores
* Records notes of students
* Tabulate assignment or class statistics
* Add student's photos
